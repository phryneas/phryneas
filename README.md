# Hi, I'm Lenz Weber-Tronic.

### My vision is to help developers write better software with a great development experience.

## I'm currently looking for a new challenge.

### Who am I?

You can find a deeper insight in the "Work Experiences" section further down the page, but here is a **TLDR**:

- FullStack Senior Developer with about 20 years of experience, currently mostly working on a React, React Native, TypeScript, GraphQL and Node stack
- Maintaininer of Redux Toolkit, actively interacting with the community on GitHub, Twitter, Discord, StackOverflow and Reddit
- well-established member of the TypeScript and React communities, known for complex "type wizardry"
- deep Linux & DevOps knowledge (currently running NixOS as a daily driver and for my private "experimental cloud")
- regularly evaluating new technologies for the company-internal tech radar
- on-demand "company-internal consultant", helping teams choose and get up to speed with new technologies, helping kickstart projects, holding workshops
- conference, meetup and barcamp speaker
- and also a conference, meetup and barcamp visitor
- personal deep interest in IT security
- confident to quickly pick up new technologies. If you are thinking about hiring me way outside my current tech stack, I'm up for that challenge!

### Example positions I am looking for

- a **FullStack Senior Developer** position on
  - tooling for developers (debuggers, compilers, editors, linters etc.)
  - library/api design
  - any other project I can get enthusiastic about - you tell me :)
- an **external DevRel** position
  - showcase your product (podcasts, blog posts, conferences)
  - create code examples on how to integrate it with other products
  - interact with the community to help them use your product and find pain points in usage
  - create tutorials and a knowledge base for commonly asked questions
  - coordinate with library authors for better integration in different ecosystems
- an **internal DevRel** position
  - evaluate technologies and help teams find their right tech stack
  - teach teams on new technologies
  - help teams get unstuck
  - accompany teams through migrations and big refactors
  - mentor new employees
  - serve in the role of an "internal consultant"

The job should be full remote. I live and work in Germany (UTC+1/+2 summer time).

If you have an interesting opening for me at your company (or are thinking about creating one), please contact me at [mail@lenzw.de](mailto:mail@lenzw.de).

## Work experience & other qualifications

(recent & important first)

### RTK Query creator & maintainer (2020-now)

<details open>
<summary>toggle details</summary><p>

I created RTK Query, a data fetching & caching library to be used with Redux Toolkit.  
It is by now considered one of the "big three" REST api caching libraries in the React ecosystem, along with SWR and TanStack Query.

</p></details>

### Redux Tookit maintainer (2019-now)

<details open>
<summary>toggle details</summary><p>

As a member of the Redux team, I interact with users on Discord, StackOverflow, Reddit or in our issues on a daily basis.  
This includes helping users with questions, collecting feature requests and planning future apis with the team.

I also implemented a large portion of the Redux Toolkit code base.  
A lot of focus has gone into the TypeScript types to give our users the best possible IDE experience (autocomplete, early errors).  
The library is often mentioned as an example for very state-of-the-art library types.

</p></details>

### Senior FullStack + DevOps at [Mayflower](https://mayflower.de/) (2016-now)

<details open>
<summary>toggle details</summary><p>

Currently I work in an agile team on a 14 year old project consisting of multiple applications - from modern React frontends and React Native apps over microservices to old php monoliths and Cordova Apps, working on all parts of that stack.

My most used technologies are:

- React & React Native
- TypeScript
- GraphQL (Postgraphile, Apollo Client, NestJS, multiple servers using schema merging)
- FluentUI
- Redux
- NestJS
- node & express
- trpc & grpc
- Docker

Additionally I am part of the company-internal "Gruppe Dev" where we create an internal _technology radar_ and work on educating our devs with current technologies.

I also consult other internal teams in whichever way I can - kickstarting projects, choosing technologies, teaching concepts and reviewing code & architecture.

</p></details>

### Formal Education

Diplom der Informatik an der Universität Würzburg (sehr gut)  
Roughly equivalent to a **Master of Computer Sciences** (final grade "very good").
